prune with no HE is just worse than prune in all cases(could be due to CQ). Processing speeds are similar so HE has little to no performance impact.

prune with no CQ seems to perform better than with CQ under low K but same at higher K (83% rate)

disk 3 always worse (duh. bigger disk=more erosion==more missclassification)

these findings are obvious (if you have a clue how morphological ex work) so i dont see the need to talk about it honestly. nothing 'new' found.
